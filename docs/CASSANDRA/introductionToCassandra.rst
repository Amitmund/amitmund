Introduction To Cassandra
=========

Over here we will be having notes on Cassandra.

Traditional Datastore
-----

In Traditional datastore, we use the RDBMS (Relational database management system), which is a database management system (DBMS) that is based on the relational model as introduced by E. F. Codd.

These data stored in RDBMS has a proper schema.

RDBMS is a database management system (DBMS) that is based on the relational model.

The Data in RDBMS represented in terms of tuples (rows).

RDBMS FEATURES:

::

      I/O
      Memory management
      Lock management
      Transaction Control
      Distribution Control
      Logging Recovery
      Store management
      Process Control
      Language Processing
      Security.

Structure of the data today
-----

Structured: (e.g. Data in oracle database)
Semi-Structured: (e.g. XML)
Quasi-Structured:
Unstructured:


The 5 V's of Big Data
-----

Volume
Variety
Velocity
Value
Veracity

NoSQL
-----
NoSQL: Not only SQL.
NoSQL database provides a mechanism to store and retrieve data, which are modeled rather then thtabular relations used in Relation databases.

.. Note:: Schema agnostic

          Auto sharding and elasticity

          Highly distributable

          Easily scalable

          Integrated caching
