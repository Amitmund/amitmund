```
Name	Number	      Default           Action	Semantics
SIGHUP	1	         Terminate	        Hangup detected on controlling terminal or death of controlling process
SIGINT	2	         Terminate	        Interrupt from keyboard. Usually terminate the process. Can be triggered by Ctrl-C
SIGQUIT	3	         Core dump	        Quit from keyboard. Usually causes the process to terminate and dump core. Cab be triggered by Ctrl-\
SIGILL	4	         Core dump	        The process has executed an illegal hardware instruction.
SIGTRAP	5	         Core dump	        Trace/breakpoint trap. Hardware fault.
SIGABRT	6	         Core dump	        Abort signal from abort(3)
SIGFPE	8	         Core dump	        Floating point exception such as dividing by zero or a floating point overflow.
SIGKILL	9	         Terminate	        Sure way to terminate (kill) a process. Cannot be caught or ignored.
SIGSEGV	11	       Core dump	        The process attempted to access an invalid memory reference.
SIGPIPE	13	       Terminate	        Broken pipe: Sent to a process writing to a pipe or a socket with no reader (most likely the reader has terminated).
SIGALRM	14	       Terminate	        Timer signal from alarm(2)
SIGTERM	15	       Terminate	        Termination signal. The kill command send this signal by default, when no explicit signal type is provided.
SIGUSR1	30,10,16	 Terminate	        First user-defined signal, designed to be used by application programs which can freely define its semantics.
SIGUSR2	31,12,17	 Terminate	        Second user-defined signal, designed to be used by application programs which can freely define its semantics.
SIGCHLD	20,17,18	 Ignore	            Child stopped or terminated
SIGCONT	19,18,25	 Continue / Ignore	Continue if stopped
SIGSTOP	17,19,23	 Stop	              Sure way to stop a process: cannot be caught or ignored. Used for non interactive job-control while SIGSTP is the interactive stop signal.
SIGTSTP	18,20,24	 Stop	              Interactive signal used to suspend process execution. Usually generated by typing Ctrl-Z in a terminal.
SIGTTIN	21,21,26	 Stop	              A background process attempt to read from its controlling terminal (tty input).
SIGTTOU	22,22,27	 Stop	              A background process attempt to write to its controlling terminal (tty output).
SIGIO	  23,29,22	 Terminate	        Asynchronous I/O now event.
SIGBUS	10,7,10	   Core dump	        Bus error (bad memory access)
SIGPOLL	           Terminate	        Signals an event on a pollable device.
SIGPROF	27,27,29	 Terminate	        Expiration of a profiling timer set with setitimer.
SIGSYS	12,-,12	   Core dump	        Invalid system call. The Kernel interpreted a processor instruction as a system call, but its argument is invalid.
SIGURG	16,23,21	 Ignore	Urgent      condition on socket (e.g. out-of-band data).
SIGVTALRM	26,26,28 Terminate	        Expiration of a virtual interval timer set with setitimer.
SIGXCPU	24,24,30	 Core dump	        CPU soft time limit exceeded (Resource limits).
SIGXFSZ	25,25,31	 Core dump	        File soft size limit exceeded (Resource limits).
SIGWINCH 28,28,20  Ignore	            Informs a process of a change in associated terminal window size.
